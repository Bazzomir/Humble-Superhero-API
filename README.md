# Humble-Superhero-API

# Project Overview

The Humble Superhero API is a simple yet meaningful application designed to celebrate the uniqueness and humility of superheroes. Every superhero has their own special abilities, but true greatness also comes with humility. This project allows users to add superheroes along with their superpower and humility score, then view a ranked list of superheroes based on their humility.

# Tech Stack
 - Backend: `Express.js` (Node.js framework)
 - Frontend: `React.js` with `Bootstrap` for styling
 - Data Storage: In-memory database `[array]`

# "If I had more time":
 - I would deploy the project so that it is available to everyone, without having to download and install it locally.
 - I would make the Search bar functional for easier searching.
 - I would add an option to upload a picture of the Superhero.
 - I would connect it to a database (MongoDB) so that all Superheroes are constantly available.

# Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

### `cd Humble-Superhero-API`

Then enter the directory (for Front-End): 
### `cd client` 
Then enter the directory (for Back-End):
### `cd api` 

### `The steps are the same for both parts, only the direction is different!!!`

# Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

Using npm: 
### `npm install`

Using yarn: 
### `yarn install`

# Step 4: Start the Development Server

To start the local development server, run:

Using npm: 
### `npm start`

Using yarn: 
### `yarn start`

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000/`. (Front-End React.js)
This will start the application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3030/`. (Back-End Express.js)


Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission issues, try running commands with `sudo` (Mac/Linux) or PowerShell as Administrator (Windows).

If dependencies are outdated or broken, try:

### `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`

or

### `rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock && yarn install`

Conclusion

You have now successfully downloaded, installed, and run a Humble-Superhero-API application locally. Happy coding!

### `Please ensure all steps are completed correctly.`
